# Ghost Ullistration
 Ghost Effect Code

Script provides player with 5 ghost images of the player. Ghosts copy position and rotation of the player once per 0.15 seconds. 
It requires player prefab with fadeOut animation using DOTween.

You asked for a short code fragment, so I didn't provide full scene illustration and recorded the video instead. 
Please, watch the video to see the example.
